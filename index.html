    <p><b class="name">Isamu Noguchi</b> (<i lang="jap">野口 勇</i>, Noguchi Isamu, November 17, 1904 – December 30, 1988) was a Japanese American artist and landscape architect whose artistic career spanned six decades, from the 1920s onward.[1] Known for his sculpture and public works, Noguchi also designed stage sets for various Martha Graham productions, and several mass-produced lamps and furniture pieces, some of which are still manufactured and sold.</p>

    <p>In 1947, Noguchi began a collaboration with the <a href="https://www.hermanmiller.com/">Herman Miller</a> company, when he joined with <b class="person">George Nelson, Paul László and Charles Eames</b> to produce a catalog containing what is often considered to be the most influential body of modern furniture ever produced, including the iconic Noguchi table which remains in production today.[2] His work lives on around the world and at the <a href="https://www.noguchi.org/museum/visit/">Noguchi Museum in New York City.</a></p>
